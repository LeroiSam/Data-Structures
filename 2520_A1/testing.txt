Thoroughness of testing program :

The testing program was used to check that the stack ADT 
was working correctly with the coordinate ADT.  It has 
one function that tests correct usage to make sure that 
the push, pop, and peek functions work correctly (along 
with the create_stack and destroy_stack).  The second 
function test when invalid arguments are passed into the 
stack functions (such as popping and peeking an empty 
stack, and pushing an empty node).  The results of all 
the tests must be examined by eye.  Note: All tests are 
successful.

For testing the memory management and the destroy func-
tions, I used valgrind (make testValgrindCheck).

Testing for maze program :

To test the maze-solving program, I used this website : 
http://www.delorie.com/game-room/mazes/ which was provided 
in the assignment description to create mazes of varying 
but valid sizes.  I checked the result from my program 
against the solution found on the website.  In all cases, 
the two solutions were identical.  

For testing the memory management and the destroy functions, 
I used valgrind (make mazeValgrindCheck).
