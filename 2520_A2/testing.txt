Report on Testing

I think that the testing done in the test program is adequate;
it tests all the functions in the phoneBook.c file with enough 
inputs that could possibly break it, making sure that all the 
functions in the phoneBook.c file are properly working.  All of
the functions in the hash table ADT are used in this, in a 
slightly more usable interface. The testing program performs all 
of the tests as expected, it sorts the lists correctly, searches 
the table correctly and adds files to the table correctly.  
All testing that I did with the phone program manually were 
passed as well. 

In addition, I tested both programs with Valgrind to ensure 
that there were no memory leaks, and this was also passed.

Please note : The same hash function was used for this table
as was used for lab 6, the testing program and results were 
included in that lab.  In addition, I included the Lab6 direct-
ory in the docs directory of this assignment for reference.
